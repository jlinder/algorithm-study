Algorithm Study
===============

This is the Algorithm Study project, a project where I implement lots of algorithms and data structures
in a variety of languages. I'm working on this project for fun and am sharing it because maybe someone
else will find it useful.

Some implementations are accompanied by a discussion of the big O run time and memory limits, some
include discussion of how the algorithm / data structure is commonly used and some include comparisons
with similar algorithms / data structures. All implementations have accompanying tests which exercise
their functionality.

To further aid in the understanding of how the algorithms operate, the Algorithm Visualizer sub-project
provides visual representations of many of the algorithms as they do their jobs. I wrote it back in 2009
with GWT (cringe) and haven't touched it since. Sometime I might get around to reimplementing it in a
more modern way.


Project Contents
================

- **AlgorithmVisualizer**: Software that represents algorithms in a visual manner to aid in a deeper
  understanding of how the algorithms operate
- **java**: Algorithm implementations in Java
- **python**: Algorithm implementations in Python
- **website**: The Algorithm Study website (it's old, it's out of date. I'll update it at some point.)
