I.    PROJECT SUMMARY

      This is the Algorithm Study project, a project to provide sample
      implementations of a large array of algorithms and data structures in a
      variety of languages. Each implementation is accompanied by a discussion
      of the big O run time and memory limits. Some implementations include
      discussion of how the algorithm / data structure is commonly used and
      comparisons with similar algorithms / data structures and all
      implementations have test cases which exercise their functionality.
