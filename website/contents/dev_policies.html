<h1> Code Style Guide </h1>

<p>
As one of the goals of the Algorithm Study project is for the source code to be
read and studied, it is important that the code be formatted in a consistent
manner.  This page describes the coding style used for all code committed to
this project.  While the coding conventions may not match your preferred style,
please follow them; a submitted patch that does not follow these coding
conventions may be rejected based simply on formatting grounds.
</p>

<h2> Java Style </h2>

<p>
For the most part, the Java code in the Algorithm Study project follows Sun's
<a href="http://java.sun.com/docs/codeconv">Java Code Conventions</a>.  The
exceptions to Sun's Java code conventions are outlined below.
</p>

<h3>Indentation</h3>
<ul>

<li> Lines cannot exceed 100 characters </li>
<li>
  Indentation must be 2 spaces except when continuing an expression or
  declaration from a previous line; in such cases, 4 spaces should be used.
</li>
<li>
  <strong>No Tabs</strong>.  Tabs are simply not allowed.  All editors can be
  configured to convert tabs to spaces.  Make your editor do so.
</li>
</ul>

<h3> Comments </h3>
<ul>
<li>
  <span class="bold">All</span> files must include javadocs, including unit
  tests
</li>
<li>
  Multi-line comments should use /* ... */, while single line comments should
  use //
</li>
<li>
  Do not use trailing comments (i.e. comments at the end of a line).  To
  comment a line of code place the comment immediately above the line.
</li>
</ul>

<h3> Declarations </h3>
<ul>
<li>
  Use one declaration per line, and use the standard
  <a href="http://java.sun.com/docs/codeconv">Java naming conventions</a>.
</li>
<li> Class level declarations belong at the top of the class definition. </li>
</ul>

<h3> Exceptions </h3>

<ul>
<li>
  Never catch Exception or RuntimeException.  Always catch the most specific
  type of exception thrown and handle the exception properly.
</li>
</ul>

<h3> Whitespace </h3>
<ul>
<li>
  Avoid ascii art.  This includes lining up method arguments that exceed a
  single line, indenting the right side of declaration assignment operators
  to make them all line up, and any other use of whitespace that does not
  indicate a semantic change.  Using indentation to indicate that code is
  within a code block (and within a certain scope) is required, of course.
</li>
<li> Avoid extra blank lines unless it improves readability. </li>

</ul>

<h3> Eclise Format Configuration </h3>

<p>
  An Ecplise formatter definintion file that (nearly) matches this policy is
  included in the Algorithm Study's source repository at
  <a href="http://algstudy.git.sourceforge.net/git/gitweb.cgi?p=algstudy;a=blob;f=java/misc/Eclipse_Formatter-alg-study_Conventions.xml;hb=HEAD">
  java/misc/Eclipse_Formatter-alg-study_Conventions.xml
  </a>.
</p>

<p>
  To install the formatter:

  <ol>
    <li> Right click on project in package explorer, select "Properties" </li>
    <li> expand "Java Code Style" </li>
    <li> select "Formatter"</li>
    <li> check "Enable project specific settings" </li>
    <li>
      import the
  <a href="http://algstudy.git.sourceforge.net/git/gitweb.cgi?p=algstudy;a=blob;f=java/misc/Eclipse_Formatter-alg-study_Conventions.xml;hb=HEAD">
        eclipse format configuration file
      </a>
    </li>
  </ol>
</p>
