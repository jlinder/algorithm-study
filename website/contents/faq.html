<h3>General Questions</h3>

What is the Algorithm Study project? <br /><br />

The Algorithm Study project implements a wide variety of algorithms and data
structures.  The implementations are accompanied by discussion of their uses,
big O analysis of their run time and memory use, comparisons with similar
algorithms and references to other sources for further study.

What is the goal of the Algorithm Study project? <br /><br />

The goal of the Algorithm Study project is to provide implementations of as many
algorithms and data structures as possible, in a wide variety of languages,
comparisons with similar algorithms, discussion of their uses and their Big O
run time and memory use properties, and references to additional information.
<br /><br />

By grouping implementations of algorithms together in this manner, it is hoped
that others will find this resource a bridge between the theoretical study of
algorithms and the practical need to use those algorithms in their projects and
studies.

Who are the intended users of the Algorithm Study? <br /><br />

People looking to increase their knowledge of standard and not-so-standard
algorithms and data structures, and software developers or engineers needing
practical and working examples of algorithms for use in their applications.

Why would I want to use the Algorithm Study? <br /><br />

If you are studying algorithms from a theoretical perspective and desire a
practical grounding in how those algorithms are implemented or used in real
code, the Algorithm Study discusses real uses of each implemented algorithm
and shows how the algorithm can be used through test cases.<br /><br />

If you are doing programming work and need a reference implementation of an
algorithm on which to base your work, the algorithms implemented by the
Algorithm Study are real implementations with test cases showing they work.
Furthermore, since the code is released under the BSD license, these
implementations can easily be used in other projects whether they are open
source or closed source.

Where can I get the source?<br /><br />

See the <a href="source_code.html">Source Code</a> page.

Is the Algorithm Study under active development? <br /><br />

Yes!  Implementations of additional algorithms are being completed and released
on a regular basis. <br /><br />

How can I contribute? <br /><br />

Join the conversation on the Algorithm Study mailing list.  If your favorite
algorithm is missing from the implemented algorithms, implement it and send
a patch to the mailing list.  If you want to work on the project but don't
know where to start, introduce yourself and the team can help you find
an algorithm to work on.  There are lots of things to do. <br /><br />
