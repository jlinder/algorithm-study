<h3>Algorithm Study Releases Version 0.2.0</h3>
<h4>April 11, 2009</h4>

<p>
  The Algorithm Study project is pleased to announce the release of Algorithm
  Study version 0.2.0.  This release introduces the
  <a href="visualizer/">Algorithm Visualizer</a>, a program that visually
  displays how algorithms work.  The algorithms included in this release are
  bubble sort, insertion sort, quick sort and heap sort.
</p>

<p>
  The Algorithm Study project provides implementations of algorithms in a
  variety of languages.  The implementations are designed to be easy-to-read and
  understand, to serve as a reference for the practicing software developer and
  to serve as a study aid for those studying algorithms and who are looking for
  a blend of the practical and theoretical.  So
  <a href="source_code.html">download or check out</a> the source code,
  interact with <a href="visualizer/">algorithm visualizations</a>, read the
  Algorithm Study <a href="faq.html">FAQ</a>, or browse the
  <a href="javadoc/">JavaDoc API</a> documentation to learn how the Algorithm
  Study project can help you.
</p>

<p>
  The Algorithm Study is open source software.  Algorithm implementations are
  released under the BSD license.  The Algorithm Visualizer is released under
  the GNU GPL v2.0.
