</p>

<p>
There are a lot of algorithms and data structures in the world of computer
science; Some are common knowledge, some are less well-known.  Many books
discuss said algorithms, usually with a large dose of math and theory.
</p>

<p>
The algorithm study project aims to provide tools and resources to augment
the traditional study of algorithms, including:  1) real implementations of
common and less-common algorithms in a variety of languages, and 2)
visualization tools to help in gaining a deeper understanding of the algorithms.
</p>

<h3>The Implementations</h3>
<p>
Each implementation is accompanied by a discussion of the big O run time and
memory limits of the algorithm.  Some implementations include discussion of how
the algorithm / data structure is commonly used and comparisons with similar
algorithms / data structures.  All implementations have test cases that exercise
their functionality.
</p>

<p>
Current algorithms include list, heap and sorting algorithms.  Some future
categories of algorithms will include: queues, stacks, trees, graphs, searching,
string manipulation and dynamic programming.  The first language of
implementation is Java.
</p>

<h3>The Visualizations</h3>
<p>
Seeing an algorithm do its work can be a powerful learning tool.  The Algorithm
Visualizer (see the link to the left), displays visually what happens as
various algorithms do their work.  Algorithm Visualizer currently shows a few
sorting algorithms at work.  Future visualizations will include lists, queues,
trees, graphs and dynamic programming algorithms.
