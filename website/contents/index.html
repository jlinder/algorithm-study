<p>
There are a lot of algorithms and data structures in the world of computer
science.  Some are standard and well-known, some are not so standard or not so
well-known.  There are plenty of books that discuss the workings of many
algorithms and often those books provide (pseudo) code snippets for the
algorithms being discussed.  Just as often, it can be difficult to find
complete, working implementations of those algorithms in the language of your
choice and ready for a test drive.

<p>
The goal of the algorithm study project is to provide sample implementations
of a large array of algorithms and data strucutres in a variety of languages.
Each implementation is accompanied by a discussion of the big O run time and
memory limits.  Some implementations include discussion of how the algorithm /
data structure is commonly used and comparisons with similar algorithms / data
structures and all implementations have test cases which exercise their
functionality.  Java is the first language in which the algorithms are provided.
